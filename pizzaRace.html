    The three photographs above display pizza consumers Charles Lefebvre (18), Saaketh Reddy (17), and Daniel Gaevskiy (17) preparing to race for food.

    "Murder Danny! Murder Danny! Murder Danny!" shouted Lefebvre in his mind, as he positioned to run. While you may think this reaction is overly brutal for such an occasion, there have been many external factors contributing to the brutality of this event, most significantly the high rates of pizza inequality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reddy in particular was a victim of this inequality: "Okay, okay, okay, I see my pizza slice that I got from the E-board and at that moment I see a huge slice of pizza, then they give me a miniscule slice of pizza. What the [expletive]?! How come some people get like one fourth of a pizza and I get this tiny sliver, the utter disbelief!"

  <p>
    This scenario is yet another demonstration of the correlation between iequality and violence. This gets even clearer as violence increased once Gaevskiy attained his pizza slice.

  <p>
    "Oh sugar honey ice tea!" screamed Gaevskiy as he was clobbered by Lefebvre. This was his reaction to the brutality that comes with pizza inequality. We must stop this, immediately.
