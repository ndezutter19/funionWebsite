<center><h1>Twitter Users EXPLODE In Rage Over Lasgana Cooked With Imagination&#8482;
</h1></center>

<p>
  Whipped coffee, move over, we have a new best recipe. Twitter user @bigbubba43 took the web by storm on Friday when he posted a video of himself preparing a date night dinner for his girlfriend. Bubba wanted to make a fresh meaty lasagna, but he forgot some ingredients, so he had to improvise.

  Bubba began with the noodles, which he had the perfect substitute: stale bread. “The stale bread provides the same glutenous taste you expect from the noodles, while keeping a firm texture, even with the sauce” commented Bubba. “You could barely notice the difference.”

  Next up, the sauce. “I was really struggling to think of how to make a good sauce, but once I came up with the solution, I knew it was genius.” Bubba used water as the base of his sauce, adding in apple skin for the signature color. “Most of flavor comes from what your mind imagines it to be, and the red-water looks just like tomato sauce. My mind could barely tell the difference.”

  What lasagna is complete without meat though? “There isn’t one correct way to imitate meat, in fact you have to use a variety of methods to get it to be just right”. Bubba replicated the texture of the meat with sponges he cut up into chunks, and then rubbed his hands over. “The sponges have the perfect amount of resistance to the tooth as the meat does, and the flavor of my hands made it identical to cow.”

  All the lasagna needed to finish was the cheese. “The cheese was the hardest part, but I think I nailed the head on it. I don’t even think this should be a substitution, this should be the default for lasagna.” Bubba needed that milky flavor of cheese, while having the same shredded consistency of cheese, so what else would Bubba use than grass? “Cheese comes from milk, and milk comes from cows. What do cows eat? Grass. Why go through all the trouble in the first place?”

  Many people are split on how to feel about Bubba’s creation. Some users, like @dankmemer420 commented “This is the future of cooking. Best recipe ever. 11/10”, while others, such as user @gordonramsay commented “What am I looking at. This is a disgrace to mouths the world over. Disgusting.”
