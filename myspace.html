  <p>In a recent study on the social development of Artificial Intelligence, major company MySpace created an artificial intelligence that learned its communication skills via social media. “We wanted to test how an AI would behave if it was fed human conversation,” commented CEO Elon Susk. “Naturally, we chose to use the crux of social media, MySpace.”</p>

	<p>The AI was fed 100,000 Myspace conversations, in order to build its vocabulary and communication skills. Afterward, MySpace researchers tested the robot’s skills by having it participate in 1-on-1 online conversations with local high school students.</p> 
	<p>Disguised as John Roberts, a human male of 16 years old, the robot took to the text messages of students around the community. After 100 conversations, we interviewed some of the students to see if they were able to identify whether the AI was real or not. In the poll, 100 students were able to see through the robot’s disguise. We asked some of these astute students how they were able to uncover the true identity of John Roberts.</p> 
	<p>“He kept on using words like ‘totes’ and ‘Yeet’ and ‘holla’, I knew he was either a robot or from like the 1980s or something” commented Ashley Haynes, local junior.</p>
	<p>“When I asked him who he had remaining in his march madness bracket, he talked about Florida winning last year so putting them high, and talking about how they got so many ‘buckets’” said Andrew Sutton, varsity basketball captain. “Florida isn’t even in this year, who thought this was convincing?”</p>

	<p>Overall, it seems like machine’s ability to mimic human language is still lacking. “We will get there some day,” Susk commented. “It may not be today, or tomorrow, or this week, or this month, or this year, or this century, but we will get there.”</p>
