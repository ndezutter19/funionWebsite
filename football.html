<center><h1>Football players: “we like the brain damage, actually”</h1></center>

  <p>  The NFL has been long in hot water over the controversies about the long term health effects caused by participation in the sport. In the past, many veterans of the league came out to tell their story about how their lives have been affected by the brain damage sustained during their time playing. Many believed that this public pressure would lead to better safety measures designed to protect the athletes in the long run. However, in a bold stand against the medical community and common sense, many professional athletes have said that they “like the brain damage”. “I uh… I have read the health consequences and… I have read the consequences and decided that… that I like brain damage. It um… lets me focus on the sport more.” said Seattle Falcon running back Waine Plymouth.

<p>  This sentiment has become very common among players, the league says. “We’ve done the data analysis and found that the players who have spoken out in the past were actually very wrong.”, said John Susman, current president of the NFL. When asked what data analysis had been done, our reporter was promptly removed from the conference room by security. We wanted to reach out to the athletes who had originally voiced their concerns about safety, but they were all unavailable due to their premature death due to CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy).
