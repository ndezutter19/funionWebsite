 Science has a strange way of delivering its innovations. Sometimes, seemingly useless things we discover at one point in time might end up supporting the greatest creations, such as the discovery of x-rays. But other times, innovations occur far too late, as is the case with cucumbers: the greatest way to slow the spread of COVID.

    Rickle Pick rushed out of his house at an early 6am to commute to a meeting at work. However, in his hurried mindset, one thing slipped his mind: his COVID-19 test.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. Pick had been exposed to a family member with COVID-19 the week before, and therefore wanted to conduct a test to be approved to go to work. Mr. Pick only realized his mistake as he stepped onto the subway.
  </p>
  <p>
    "I started hyperventilating, like I had a heart attack," describes Pick, and understandably so. Passing COVID-19 to others in his workplace might have been the end of his job. Fortunately, geniuses are often created through stress, and Mr. Pick was one of them
  </p>
  <p>
    "I was looking all around me, looking and looking for something to relieve my COVID. The answer came to me when I saw a little girl eating a hotdog. The fresh, green cucumber shined at me like the north star."
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. Pick proceeded to tear the cucumber from the hot dog, the girl crying almost immedately. But her tears wouldn't go to waste. As Mr. Pick stuck the fresh fruit into his nostril, and kept it their throughout his whole meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day, he took a COVID test, and to his dismay, found that he did in fact have the disease. However, when he reported this fact to his workplace, it so happened that none of his colleagues were affected
  </p>
  <p>
    Mr. Pick promptly went to a lab to find how his disease did not spread, the results he found were nothing short of revolutionary.

    "In the microscopes, they showed me the small virus particles, and right on them, I saw the green molecules of the cucumber, bonding to their surface and slowing them down."
  </p>
  <p>
    The scientists plan to conduct more tests in the future, but there's no denying the science: cucumbers slow the spread of COVID, and if you aren't sticking a cucumber in your nose now, you are killing little children.
