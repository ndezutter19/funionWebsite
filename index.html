  <p>During the 2022 Oscars, something unbelievable happend, something no one could have ever seen coming. Yeah that’s right, Will Smith, of “Fish Tales” fame won the “Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role” for the movie “King Richard”. His brilliant performance in the heart warming movie of a dad trying to raise a future superstar touched the hearts of the academy. The cinematic masterpiece that was this movie was unbelievable, especially when you find the father character working multiple jobs just to support his children. Oh yeah, I guess he did have a spat with Marty the zebra from Madagascar as well.

  <p><b> Yes! </b>A recent study has shown that on average, people who code for just 30 minutes a day have better stamina and more muscle mass than professional athletes. It is being hypothesized that there is a strong correlation between a desire to code and being really cool and awesome. Coders are being recruited in droves by athletic programs all over the nation to bolster their rosters. <b><a href="shrug.html"> Source: </a></b></p>

     <h2><b>Breaking: </b> Michael Jordan admitted he has never seen the hit film “Space Jam” ↓
</h2> 
    <img class="imageOnPage" src="../jordan.png">
  <p>In an utterly bewildering chat on ESPN's "The Unseen Side of Sports," basketball icon Michael Jordan dropped a bombshell that has left fans scratching their heads: he has never watched "Space Jam," the slam-dunk of a film from 1996 that starred, well, him. “Back in the day, I was juggling basketballs, baseballs, and golf balls—not to mention the occasional cartoon character. Watching my own movie? That got benched harder than a fifth-string point guard. I just figured, 'Eh, I'll catch it later.' But later never came.” He added with a chuckle, “I guess I’m hoping my fans and the Looney Tunes can forgive me. It’s time to patch up that trust, one wacky basketball game at a time.”

  <h2><b> Game Review: Rock Paper Scissors </b> By: Angus J. ↓
</h2> 
    <img class="imageOnPage" src="https://shapegrams.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RPS-Featured-Image-1600x1600.png">
  <p>In the 87 hours that it took me to beat Rock Paper Scissors, I was put through an absolute wringer of emotion: Anger as I was beaten down by its toughest challenges, exhilaration when I finally overcame them, and a fair amount of sorrow for the mountains of times I lost against my friends. But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe – from the many absolutely jaw-dropping strategies, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous number of possibilities, 9, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Rock Paper Scissors nearly always rewarded my ingenuity with either an interesting challenge, a valuable experience, or something even greater. The ancient Chinese take the ball that tic-tac-toe got rolling and run with it, creating an interesting and big-brained strategy game, while also being extremely simple. It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that Rock Paper Scissors ended up as one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I’ve ever had.

  <h2>Funion journalist arrested ↓ </h2> 
    <img class="imageOnPage" src="https://i.imgflip.com/1g1n4k.jpg">
  <p>In an attack against the free press, a Funion news journalist was arrested for exposing the corruption of Chuck E. Cheeses. Kevin Lowrey was in the field doing research about the “Big Bass Wheel” arcade game when he was suddenly surrounded by both local police and Federal Bureau of Investigation special officers. Our journalist was collecting data about the probability an outcome has, versus the percentage of the surface area that the outcome has on the wheel. What he found was absolutely shocking. The 200 ticket jackpot, despite taking up 0.5% of the wheel, was only rolled a total of 37 times, out of 10,422 rolls. When a 1 proportion z test is ran with this data, we receive a p value of only 0.018. This data is not only statistically significant, but proves scientifically that Chester E. Cheese of Chuck E. Cheese fame is not only a fraudster, but a ruffian and a scoundrel. How many other games has he rigged in his interest? How many red blooded Americans have been bamboozled out of their hard earned money? How much more must the middle class suffer before something is done? We at Funion news will not rest until Kevin is safe at home and Mr. Cheese has been arrested and tried for his crimes. Viva la Kevin!

    <img class="imageOnPage" src="https://pixfeeds.com/images/22/538768/1200-171241983-man-helping-to-senior-woman.jpg">
  <p>A local citizen, Kyle Vurnes, has been spotted walking with an elderly woman. The woman, Katherine Mills, was walking home from the local Target, when Vurnes stopped her at a cross stop. Local eyewitnesses report that Vurnes stopped the old woman for a minute, then took her grocery bags, and walked the rest of the way home with her. We asked local residents what they thought about the actions. “I think it was the right thing to do'' says Emily Blume, a stay at home mom. “It was nice I guess” says local businessman Thomas Holne. 
Vurnes has been spotted by the news previously, doing things such as climbing a tree to get down his neighbor’s cat, or moving his neighbor’s mail out of the rain for them. What will he do next?
