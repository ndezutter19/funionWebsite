  <h3> Interview Transcript: </h3>
    <br>
  <div id="fullArticle">
  <p><b>Interviewer: </b>Thank You so much Mr. Gas for allowing this one of a kind interview opportunity.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Mr. Gas: </b>You’re very welcome. I understand that there is a lot of misinformation out there about why these prices are so high right now and I really want to clear that up.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Interviewer: </b>And I'm extremely interested in hearing that answer, but answering it too quickly would be convenient for the viewer, so please. Answer these 4 other questions no one cares about first.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Mr. Gas: </b>Of course.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Interviewer: </b>Great. Electric vehicles are the hottest commodity in an increasingly environmentally conscious world, with many western governments planning on banning all future sales of internal combustion engine vehicles. How do you think this trend towards EVs will affect your gasoline empire?</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Mr. Gas: </b>That's a very good question, thank you. To be completely honest with you, there will be no banning of combustion engines. Since 1913, I have been building my wealth in anticipation for this moment. I have the funds to buy enough representatives in congress to keep combustion engines on the menu for almost a thousand years.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Interviewer: </b>(~silence~)</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Mr. Gas: </b>(~silence~)</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Interviewer: </b>Well that's wonderful. Now, Mr. Gas, our viewers have been dying to hear if you have any plans on updating the current version of gasoline. Do you and your engineers have anything in the works?</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Mr. Gas: </b>Why yes, actually, we do. We have been hard at work specially formulating a new version of gasoline that produces five times as much carbon dioxide emissions. This new innovation will expedite global warming to extinction level events in as soon as 4 years. We are tremendously excited to explore the potential of these substances.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Interviewer: </b>(~silence~)</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Mr. Gas: </b>(~silence~)</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Interviewer: </b>Ok… um how about we skip to what the viewers at home want to hear. Why did you, Mr. Gas, CEO of gas, man who decides gas prices globally, decide to raise them so severely recently?</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Mr. Gas: </b>Money</p>
<br><br>
