      We don't really know where “the Joker” came from. Chris said he showed up one day before he had entered the office and was huddled in the corner, going “hehehehe”. He didn't really wanna get involved, so he just left him there. Its been like three months and he hasn't moved, but he also hasn’t messed with anyone, and we really just don't want to bother him. Margaret kinda likes his presence, so we might just keep him.

      Chris is the only person here who should be legally allowed to own things. Chris started working for the Funion in 2018 because he walked into the wrong building and we were desperate. Thankfully he’s the best thing to have ever happened to this god forsaken place. He is the only employee who has smiled in 8 months. I wake up in a cold sweat every morning imagining what would happen to this place if Chris left. He was sick for one day and in the span of that 8 hour work day: the microwave broke, 3 lights fell out of the ceiling, the Joker started crying for no reason, the printer exploded, lead poisoned the tap water, and rabid dogs chased phoebe to her car in the parking lot and all the way home. I swear to god, I came into work the next day after Chris and everything was fixed.

      Sean graduated top of his class in the third grade. Since then he has become a master of the harmonica and mediocre at basketball. Sean joined the Funion team 3 years ago when he walked into one of our cameramen, knocking him over and destroying a five thousand dollar camera. He could not afford to replace it, so he agreed to work for us and stipend his pay till it is paid off. He is by far the worst employee we have, and if you’re reading this Sean, I know that it's you taking my lunch out of the fridge. Stop it.

      Phoebe Rallie was the first employee I hired to work at the Funion. She came from Minnesota (I couldn’t believe that place actually existed until she told me). She graduated in the middle of her class in St. Olaf College, right on the average line (ain’t that just incredible). I gave her a job on the 2nd floor (out of the three floors) with the desk on the middle of said floor. She got a desk that was not too small (but not too big) with some amounts of chipping in the wood (but not too much) and a broken chair (but not too broken). Viewers find her work interesting, so much so that every rating she has received has been three and a half stars. I could have had a number of people who are better, but hey, I could have had the same number of people who are worse.
