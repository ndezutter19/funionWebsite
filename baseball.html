<center><h1>Physicists vs Zack Greinke: How one baseball player defied all conceived notions of reality</h1></center>

  <p>  Baseball, America’s pastime. There is no better way to spend an evening than at a ballgame. In recent years however, the sport has been evolving along with modern scientific understanding. Scientists understood curveballs moved according to gravity, but only recently have scientists begun to comprehend why. Despite this, one player has shattered all understanding of both the game, and physics, as we know it.
	Zack Greinke has always been known as an odd player, always changing the way he plays the game. Physicists have been at a loss for words however after witnessing his new curveball. Curveballs, since the dawn of the sport, have fallen down, moving with gravity. “The grip on the ball causes the aerodynamic forces to push the ball down even more, messing with the batter’s senses” says physicist Joan Wimbly, from Harvard University.

<p>  Greinke’s curveball, colloquialized as the “Wonderball”, sees the ball rise as it travels. “Greinke’s pitches seem to be rising, for reasons we have yet to understand,'' our scientist wrote. “We think the balls still experience gravity, but he has somehow either figured out a form of pitching we can not understand, or has forced god to bend reality to his will.” Greinke’s curveball has stumped our scientists. “balls should never be able to travel upwards, the most they could do is fall slower.”

	Greinke’s curveball floats through the air until it gets close enough to the batter, where it immediately juts upwards, flying over the batter towards the heavens. 13 spectators have been injured by these pitches with lawsuits pending. When asked about how he was able to break the laws of physics, Greinke, in between sips of mug root beer, responded, “I don’t know. I just threw it.”
