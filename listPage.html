        <h2> An Active Volcano  </h2>

          <p>To some, the sound of burbling lava and fiery hot atmosphere soothes the soul. However, in a recent study, scientists have drawn a frightening connection to being near and active volcano and dying. It is for this reason that an active volcano lands at #5 on our list.

        <h2> Any Sidewalk In North Dakota </h2>

        <p>North Dakota often comes up when discussing the worst states in America and for good reason. North Dakota is in the bottom 50% of almost every statistic imaginable. However, there is one category where the state stands on top, and that is the percentage of drivers with DUIs. With 6% of licensed North Dakotan drivers having a DUI on their record, choosing to walk the streets is a gamble at best, and a death sentence at worst, getting run over by Cleetus in his 2009 Chevrolet silverado.</p>

        <h2> The Link Lab During Passing Periods </h2>

        <p> The link: a small but vital building connecting the east and west buildings of Stevenson High School, allowing passage in the event of inclement weather conditions. While innocent on the surface, the rampant tramplings (seen above), blockages, and suffering experienced by pedestrians places the Stevenson High School Link Lab at #3 on our list</p>

        <h2> Tightrope Walking on Power Cables</h2>
        <img id="powerCable" src="https://assets.taraenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/power-surge-occuring-on-powerlines.jpg">
        <p>Power cables, they're everywhere. They take up space, they are ugly, and quite frankly, they need more uses. This train of thought has led a select few people to create the community of “The Power Cable Acrobats”. This group of amatuer tight rope walkers has chosen power lines as their target of death defying stunts. Except that not a single member has defied death, with a very rare 100% death rate among group members brazen enough to make an attempt, landing power cables as #2 most dangerous places to walk.

        <p>Detroit. Do I *need* to elaborate? A city famous for crime, dilapidation, and a housing market so low that real estate is being given away.</p>
