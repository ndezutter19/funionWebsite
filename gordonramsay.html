    The video was an instant hit, and hundreds of social media accounts attempted to post their own attempts at the recipe. #FunyunChicken is currently trending on Twitter at the time of this article.

    The trend began with the chef himself, who did his own mother's day tweet on the matter:

    One user, under the username "Cringelord", has uploaded a picture of himself in front of his flaming stove in attempt to cook this fine recipe:

    As a result of this, Funyun prices have skyrocketed with consumers running to stores to try the recipe themselves. This has led to an inflation rate of Funyuns of 100% a day. Will the economy recover from this? We may only wait.
